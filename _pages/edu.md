<!--My teaching activities focus on modern statistical data analysis, and its applications in life sciences and digital humanities. This includes in particular in modern theory, methods and applications of modern statistical data analysis, machine learning, probabilistic programming and artificial intelligence (AI). The main application areas include functional genomics, microbial ecology of the human body, large population cohort studies, computational history, open research software, and open science.-->
