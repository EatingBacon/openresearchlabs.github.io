independently and critically and to produce new scientific knowledge within his/her field of research;
 * becomes conversant with the development, basic problems and research methods
of his/her own field of research;
 * acquires such knowledge of the general theory of science and of other disciplines relating to his/her own field of research which enables him/her to follow
developments in them;
 * acquires sufficient communication and language skills and other necessary skills in order to work in extensive and demanding expert and development roles and in international collaborative settings.
